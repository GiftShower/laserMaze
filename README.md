# Laser maze problem

(Actually it's laser chess but unfortunately I am too lazy to fix this)

![prb](https://github.com/GiftShower/laserMaze/blob/master/image/problem.jpg)

This repo is my solution, written in Kotlin.

## Input

Following values should be given in testcase.txt

Each value are seperated with single space.
laser starting pos x, pos y, laser direction, destination pos x, pos y

laser direction is given with numbers.

1 is left

2 is right

3 is down

4 is up


## Output

Output the coordinates and direction of the mirror
in the following format as many as the minimum number of mirrors
used to send the laser to the destination.

Output format: mirror pos x, pos y, direction

## Other solutions

- Maybe later?
